<p data-ke-size="size16">06 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">MR McGREGOR was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages but he jumped up and ran after Peter waving a rake and calling out Stop thief. PETER was most dreadfully frightened he rushed all over the garden for he had forgotten the way back to the gate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/Kz7Vs/btrARF0WHLa/JJK8PPcZZHn78Ywvwhz1I1/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">07 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages and the other shoe amongst the potatoes. AFTER losing them he ran on four legs and went faster so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">08 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. It was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite new. PETER gave himself up for lost and shed big tears but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew to him in great excitement. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">09 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">and implored him to exert himself. MR McGREGOR came up with a sieve which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter but Peter wriggled out just in time leaving his jacket behind him. AND rushed into the toolshed and jumped into a can. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bHcUYP/btrASDawTcF/l2Fa9I5X0KENpMP1JoIjW1/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">10 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in if it had not had so much water in it. MR McGREGOR was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed. perhaps hidden underneath a flower pot. He began to turn them over carefully looking under each. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">11 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Presently Peter sneezed Kertyschoo. Mr McGregor was after him in no time AND tried to put his foot upon Peter who jumped out of a window upsetting three plants. The window was too small for Mr McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">12 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">He went back to his work. PETER sat down to rest he was out of breath and trembling with fright and he had not the least idea which way to go. Also he was very damp with sitting in that can. After a time he began to wander about. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/c9jws2/btrATd4fSbM/4Yjux4u9lm25TeyX4OXbvK/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">13 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">going lippity not very fast and looking all around. HE found a door in a wall but it was locked and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath. An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">14 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. Peter asked her the way to the gate. but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. She only shook her head at him. Peter began to cry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cMI911/btrATehMKZz/p7Wzqmi849isZFKJQEPnhk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">15 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">THEN he tried to find his way straight across the garden. but he became more and more puzzled. Presently he came to a pond where Mr McGregor filled his water cans. A white cat was staring at some gold fish. she sat very still. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cUsWkM/btrAQ66jZga/vKaLKngpks6eFAoq8EFsvk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">16 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her. he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny. HE went back towards the tool shed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/DKQul/btrARLghGtn/cHKGUJAuCE1g6yePMiCov1/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">17 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">but suddenly quite close to him he heard the noise of a scritch. Peter scuttered underneath the bushes. But presently as nothing happened. he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. The first thing he saw was Mr McGregor hoeing onions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bamUSO/btrAQI5H816/ILNjkOEdD1rJKqnxdl0em0/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">18 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">His back was turned towards Peter and beyond him was the gate. PETER got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow and started running as fast as he could go. along a straight walk behind some black currant bushes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ot3Fs/btrAUyUmpFQ/zCvKVwWy7MzkVxFqe97Sn0/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">19 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;"> Mr McGregor caught sight of him at the corner but Peter did not care. He slipped underneath the gate and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden. MR McGREGOR hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare crow to frighten the blackbirds. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/okFbr/btrAQ7c64h5/C1ASapAFqYJfZOGMQTKwQk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">20 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">PETER never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir tree. He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole and shut his eyes. His mother was busy cooking. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/EWHtS/btrAQ66j9mg/2MoTAp4oxZQJYHcUqYXSfk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">21 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">she wondered what he had done with his clothes. It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight. I AM sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening. His mother put him to bed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/KN18F/btrATd4f1mh/x0OJyHYUeTX9hC6BXabC91/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">22 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;"> and made some camomile tea and she gave a dose of it to Peter. One table spoonful to be taken at bed time. BUT Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper. THE END. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">23 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Little Red Riding Hood. Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her. but most of all by her grandmother and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/d4jBKS/btrATehMQmd/u6bNqF5k0MuO1MACjiyC6k/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">24 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother said to her Come Little Red Riding Hood here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xg9cO/btrATRNnKzM/0KjmpNbqM3D0OzYZfnoblk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">25 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Take them to your grandmother she is ill and weak and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot and when you are going walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path or you may fall and break the bottle and then your grandmother will get nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cQrNKi/btrARpLm37Y/CZnnZNiKJepy4VTPTbQoHk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">26 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">And when you go into her room dont forget to say good morning and dont peep into every corner before you do it. I will take great care said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother and gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">27 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">half a league from the village and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was and was not at all afraid of him. Good day Little Red Riding Hood said he. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/NE126/btrASvKQs0t/6yeQFhG0KDKV8BlyhDqw91/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">28 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;"> Thank you kindly wolf. Whither away so early Little Red Riding Hood? To my grandmothers. What have you got in your apron? Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking day so poor sick grandmother is to have something good to make her stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/4n4LT/btrATcqKEJ1/6bw5G4ZFeMSZJ9lCh79gbK/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">29 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Where does your grandmother live Little Red Riding Hood? A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak trees the nut trees are just below. You surely must know it replied Little Red Riding Hood. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/GpFQN/btrAR8I5e6Z/kqzCD5EpvqffrgFw1eOzLK/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">30 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">The wolf thought to himself What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily so as to catch both. So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/RyOSM/btrAQ5l2F3Q/Wwm0HSgeKWTd7JFJCSQM50/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">31 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">and then he said see Little Red Riding Hood. how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe too that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bz23TG/btrARgAkMgu/Iz6tUcDzD0vgxX0xDpaiW1/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">32 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">while everything else out here in the wood is merry. Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees and pretty flowers growing everywhere. she thought suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/wxoUL/btrARqQ1yvF/tGy0rCE8nzfk6K7UG3BKZ1/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">33 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ccB4FK/btrATdJVnbO/ZMpCO4D4rsOk9IX0oGumok/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">34 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">and ran after it and so got deeper and deeper into the wood. Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmothers house and knocked at the door. Who is there? Little Red Riding Hood replied the wolf. She is bringing cake and wine. Open the door. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/o1cPR/btrATTLdwkE/CiNySuUEkNFPeK0TLmouMK/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">35 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Lift the latch called out the grandmother. I am too weak and cannot get up. The wolf lifted the latch. the door sprang open and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmothers bed and devoured her. Then he put on her clothes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/djEkF9/btrAQ7c7aUX/D1kqiPcjGQWEkegOeqdX30/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">36 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains. Little Red Riding Hood however had been running about picking flowers and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more. she remembered her grandmother and set out on the way to her. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cp4m8L/btrASuFaWZZ/aoecnZ99Ar14h846IcQQDk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">37 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">She was surprised to find the cottage door standing open and when she went into the room she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself. oh dear how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/pAC89/btrAQfB0zSb/39AKw1O5ok6NPSYKWFxF7k/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">38 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">She called out Good morning but received no answer. So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains. There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face and looking very strange. Oh grandmother she said what big ears you have. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bsl1Eb/btrAQ6rJVq1/vxfn4HAgjmktPHDRzf6bG1/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">39 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">The better to hear you with my child was the reply. But grandmother what big eyes you have she said. The better to see you with my dear. But grandmother what large hands you have. The better to hug you with. Oh but grandmother what a terrible big mouth you have. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">40 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">The better to eat you with. And scarcely had the wolf said this than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Little Red Riding Hood. When the wolf had appeased his appetite he lay down again in the bed fell asleep and began to snore very loud. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/nIPS5/btrATR7IuTa/mW7i7ECox9ZpFEQ8WokZv0/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">41 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself how the old woman is snoring. I must just see if she wants anything. So he went into the room and when he came to the bed he saw that the wolf was lying in it. Do I find you here you old sinner said he. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/kXUPZ/btrASaNHi3t/0xNmBhArHSCIGqeYkLsnaK/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">42 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">I have long sought you. Then just as he was going to fire at him. it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother and that she might still be saved so he did not fire but took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/biKirJ/btrARhTyqNH/rkKuOEdQnk1KIk9rOm8A9k/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">43 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">When he had made two snips he saw the Little Red Riding Hood shining and then he made two snips more and the little girl sprang out. crying Ah how frightened I have been. How dark it was inside the wolf. And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">44 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">but scarcely able to breathe. Little Red Riding Hood. however quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolfs belly and when he awoke he wanted to run away. but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once and fell dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/93Cow/btrATehMXLf/1kbEgTIb9T87bNJSL2HCS1/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">45 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolfs skin and went home with it. The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Little Red Riding Hood had brought and revived. but Little Red Riding Hood thought to herself. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/5yuEj/btrzq6MkAXZ/1PERNjIeCx7XRkjvKsM7Uk/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">46 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">as long as I live I will never by myself leave the path to run into the wood when my mother has forbidden me to do so. It is also related that once when Little Red Riding Hood was again taking cakes to the old grandmother. another wolf spoke to her. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
