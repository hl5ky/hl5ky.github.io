<p data-ke-size="size16">01 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Old Mother Goose and Her Son Jack. Old Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack. Jack was a very good lad and although he was not handsome he was good tempered and industrious and this made him better looking than half the other boys. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">02 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Old Mother Goose carried a long stick she wore a high crowned hat and high heeled shoes. and her kerchief was as white as snow. Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond and the Owl that sat on the wall. So you see they formed a very happy family. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">03 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">But what a fine strong fellow the Gander was. Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted to take a journey she would mount upon his broad strong back. and away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance. Now Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">04 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could find. It was early in the morning when he started and his way lay through a wood. He was not afraid of robbers. so on he went with his Mothers great clothes prop over his shoulder. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">05 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">The fresh morning air caused Jacks spirits to rise. He left the road and plunged into the thick of the wood where he amused himself by leaping with his clothes prop till he found he had lost himself. After he had made many attempts to find the path again he heard a scream. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">06 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">He jumped up and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came. Through an opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle. With one heavy blow of his staff Jack sent the thief howling away. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">07 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">and then went back to the young lady who was lying on the ground crying. She soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off and thanked Jack for his help. The young lady told Jack that she was the daughter of the Squire who lived in the great white house on the hill top. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">08 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">She knew the path out of the wood quite well and when they reached the border she said that Jack must come soon. to her fathers house so that he might thank him for his noble conduct. When Jack was left alone. he made the best of his way to the market place. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">09 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose for when he got there he was very late and there was but one left. But as it was a prime one Jack bought it at once and keeping to the road made straight for home. At first the Goose objected to be carried. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">10 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">and then when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a short time. she tried to fly away. so Jack seized her in his arms and kept her there till he reached home. Old Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird Jack had bought and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">11 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">And then they all lived very happily for a long time. But Jack would often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had rescued in the forest and soon began to sigh all day long. He neglected the garde, cared no more for the Gande, and scarcely even noticed the beautiful Goose. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">12 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">But one morning as he was walking by the pond he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise as though they were in the utmost glee. He went up to them and was surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg. He ran with it to his mother who said. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">13 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Go to market my son sell your egg and you will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire. So to market Jack went and sold his golden egg but the rogue who bought it of him cheated him out of half his due. Then he dressed himself in his finest clothes and went up to the Squires house. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">14 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Two footmen stood at the door one looking very stout and saucy, and the other sleepy and stupid. When Jack asked to see the Squire. they laughed at him and made sport of his fine clothes. but Jack had wit enough to offer them each a guinea when they at once showed him to the Squires room. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">15 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Now the Squire who was very rich was also very proud and fat and scarcely turned his head to notice Jack. but when he showed him his bag of gold and asked for his daughter to be his bride. the Squire flew into a rage, and ordered his servants to throw him into the horse pond. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">16 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">But this was not so easy to do for Jack was strong and active and then the young lady come out and begged her father to release him. This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever and he went home determined to win her in spite of all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">17 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">And well did his wonderful Goose aid him in his design. Almost every morning she would lay him a golden egg and Jack grown wiser would no longer sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated him. So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">18 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">His wealth became known to all the country round. and the Squire at length consented to accept Jack as his son in law. Then Old Mother Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride who lived happily ever afterwards. THE END. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">19 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Thumbelina. A long time ago and far, far away an old woman was sitting in her rocking chair thinking how happy she would be if she had a child. Then she heard a knock at the door and opened it. A lady was standing there and she said If you let me in I will grant you a wish. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/nuXId/btrAQRHCMeB/f1WHrfI5U5KXswIRuq0ClK/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">20 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">The old woman let the woman in firstly because she felt pity. secondly because she knew what she would wish for a child. After she washed the lady up and fed her she saw that she was really beautiful. The lady slept soundly all night long and then right before she left she said Now about your wish. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">21 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">What do you want? The lady thought about most peoples wishes to be richest in the world. most powerful person, the smartest and the prettiest. But the old woman wished for something the lady could not believe. She said I would like a child. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bGiWlB/btrAQI5IKRW/7ifyWtzUBSVKvqUqGvCJqK/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">22 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">What did you say? she asked because she was astonished at what the old lady asked for. The old lady repeated what she said. I would like a child. The lady then placed a tiny seed in the old womans hand and gave her instructions. Plant this seed water it carefully watch over it and give it your love. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">23 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">If you do all those things then you will have a child. So the old woman did all of those things the lady had told her to. In a week there was a beautiful yellow flower in place of the seed. The next day the flower bloomed. Inside the flower was a beautiful little girl who was the size of the womans thumb so she a called her Thumbellina. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p data-ke-size="size16">24 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">She made her a little dress out of golden threads. Thumbellina slept in a walnut shell and brought the old woman joy and happiness. But one day when Thumbellina went down for her nap. a frog hopped through the open window and said You will be a perfect bride for my son and she took Thumbellina to a lily pad and hopped off to find her son. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<center><audio src="https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/4iMWT/btrAQHscAjd/nWinCbaLOrTj8jo7og0i50/tfile.mp3" controls="controls"></audio></center>
<p data-ke-size="size16">25 <span style="color: #9d9d9d;">Thumbellina cried and some little guppies heard her and chewed the roots off the lily pad to help her escape. Thumbellinas lily pad floated away. A few hours later she finally stopped floating. During the summer she ate berries and drank the dew off the leaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
